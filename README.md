# Hack the South 2020 - Beeps and Boops
PureData based Hackathon Project

## Why?
Cause as an indie developer, **royalty's and copyright** is a major hurdle when creating games. As this pd patch creates completely proceduraly generated music which can be **easily implemented in game engines** (there are dedicated routing for UE4 and Unity).
The other problem is that audio files are **messy and large**. You have to consider compression and it's unwanted artefacts it creates. Then ask would yourself would you like an OGG VORBIS which deals in MB - GB or would a program that can protentially create an infinate amount of **music in the KB's** (The program comes out to just 10 KB).

## Urgh.. Why is it just lines of code?
Don't panic! You need to install pd from their [HOME PAGE](https://puredata.info/downloads). Once the association has been created on your device of choice (yes it **runs on All desktop OS's** including Raspberry Pi) you can access the GUI and edit it to your hearts content.

## PureData
The project uses an **open source visual programming language** to take simple sine/signals and convert them into somthing that sound pretty good. It has been used in a whole host of media and applications including the video game No Man Sky.
